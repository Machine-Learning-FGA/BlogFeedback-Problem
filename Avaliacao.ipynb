    "# Avaliação dos modelos de regressão criados\n",

    "Em termos gerais um regressor é um modelo de _machine learning_ que prevê uma saída, ou resultado, numérico.\n",
    "\n",
    "## _Root-mean-square error_\n",
    "\n",
    "Essa é a forma mais simples de medir a performance de um modelo de regressão. Essa técnica avalia a diferença de cada valor predito para seu valor real, e calcula a média de forma que se torna imune ao fato que valores preditos podem ser tanto maiores quanto menores que seu valor real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uma vantagem dessa técnica é que o resultado é na mesma unidade que os próprios valores, mas também se torna uma desvantagem no sentido de que o resultado depende da escala do problema. Se o valor predito ou o real forem numéros muito altos o _RMSE_ vai ser correspondentemente alto. Sendo assim, isso pode se tornar um problema quando se deseja comparar modelos de projetos diferentes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ RSME = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sqrt{\\sum{[y_i - f(x_i)]^2}} $$\n",
    "<center>onde, $x_i$ e $y_i$ são os inézimos <i>targets</i> e características e $f(x)$ representa a aplicação do medelo no vetor de características, que retorna o valor predito.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## $R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ SS_{res} = \\sum{(y_i - yhat_i)^2} $$\n",
    "<center>onde, $ (y_i - yhat_i) $ é a distância do ponto real na função para o ponto da predição.</center>\n",

    "<center>onde, $y_{avg}$ é a linha da média de todos os pontos.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sendo assim, o método de avaliação $R^2$ compara quão bom é o modelo gerado, baseado na linha média dos valores. Quanto $R^2$ está mais perto de $1$ melhor é o modelo, quanto mais longe e perto de $-1$, pior o modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$ tem um grande problema quando tratamos de funções polinomiais, pois o método $R^2$ ou não descresce ou não muda, dependendo da covariância das variáveis. Dessa forma, a melhor opção para problemas polinomiais é a utilização do $R^2$ ajustado, definido pela fórmula.\n",
